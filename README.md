# Image-Classification
Image Classification with Transfer Learning in Keras
Project Description: Implemented an image classification system using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture in Keras. The model was trained to classify images of cats and dogs from the "Cats vs Dogs" dataset.

Skills Applied: Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, Keras, TensorFlow, Python, Data Preprocessing
Tasks Accomplished:
Downloaded and prepared the "Cats vs Dogs" dataset using Python libraries.
Defined and trained a deep learning model with transfer learning using MobileNetV2.
Created data generators to handle large datasets efficiently during training.
Evaluated model performance using binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics.
Made predictions on test images and visualized results using Matplotlib.
Key Achievements:

Achieved an accuracy of 97.56% on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the trained model in classifying images of cats and dogs accurately.
Successfully implemented best practices in deep learning model development, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, and performance evaluation.
Tools & Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
